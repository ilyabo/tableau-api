Note: This project is using a older version of the Tableau Embedding API (v2.0.0, whereas v3.4.X is currently available)

To use a more up-to-date api version you can either:
* Manually download, copy, and export a version of the tableau API (as this repo's "tableau-api" dependency does). Eg from `https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/tableau.embedding.3.latest.js` as per the [Tableau docs](https://help.tableau.com/current/api/embedding_api/en-us/docs/embedding_api_get.html).
* Use an up-to-date project (such as the [TableauEmbed](https://github.com/stoddabr/react-tableau-embed-live) react component)
